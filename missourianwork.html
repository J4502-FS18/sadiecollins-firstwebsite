<p class="workintros">As part of my degree, I spent a summer reporting at the Columbia Missourian, one of my city’s newspapers. <br>
<br>
I wrote a wide assortment of articles featured in the newspaper, including centerpiece features, breaking news, obituaries and crime briefs.<br>
<br>
I learned how to handle a high-stress environment over an extended period of time and be responsible for my own copy and deadlines. It also allowed me to have independence with the direction and angles of my stories and fostered creative direction.<br>
<br>
Here are some of the articles I wrote during my time there that I am especially proud of: <br>
<br>

<p class="workintros">Additionally, for a magazine writing class and a critical reviewing class, I had several opportunities to write creative, longform articles for Vox Magazine in Columbia, Missouri. I did <a href="https://www.voxmagazine.com/magazine/the-alethea-project-extends-the-mission-of-true-false/article_3d4a3358-18f9-11e8-8de9-5f7a98c50f14.html">some reporting related to True/False Film Fest</a>, Columbia's renowned documentary film festival, and wrote a <a href="https://www.voxmagazine.com/magazine/q-a-with-rebecca-wallace-teaching-hip-hop-is-for/article_c1e6ef72-4f11-11e8-8dc5-07e09c90ab2b.html">fun Q+A about one of Columbia's residents.</a> Additionally, I wrote <a href="https://www.voxmagazine.com/arts/movies/rosie-moussa-dorothee-van-den-berghe-citizen-jane/article_7c80041c-dfa0-11e8-8a81-37512f2cfe93.html">a review for Vox about one of the films screened at Citizen Jane</a>, another film festival in Columbia that showcases female-directed films. I also pitched and wrote <a href="https://www.voxmagazine.com/arts/the-underrated-horror-novels-you-should-read-this-season/article_dac4774a-bc52-11e8-b5f1-d7829087a9a3.html">a guide to horror novels written by women</a>, offering up a varied list with something for every reader.</p>
